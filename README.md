# Systemic Risk Assessment of Financial Networks Using Graph Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on advancing the systemic risk assessment of financial networks through the use of **graph neural networks (GNNs)**. Traditional methods often fall short when modeling the complex, nonlinear, and stochastic interactions present in large-scale financial systems. This work addresses these challenges by introducing novel, highly adaptable and sequential learning frameworks based on GNNs.

## Key Contributions

- **Hybrid Modeling Frameworks**: Two tailored architectures—**SRATN** and **SMATF**—are proposed. These models combine stochastic differential equations with graph-based learning to capture both temporal and spatial dynamics.
  
- **SRATN (Stochastic Recurrent Adaptive Temporal Network)**:
  - Utilizes a multi-layered stochastic recurrent network.
  - Efficiently models macro-financial disturbances and risk transmissions across time.
  - Enhances adaptability and sequence learning.

- **SMATF (Stochastic Measure-Adaptive Temporal Framework)**:
  - Incorporates graph-based training with measure-adaptive learning.
  - Imposes financial constraints to ensure interpretability and stability.
  - Enhances risk signal regulation and improves training performance.

## Evaluation & Performance

The proposed methods are evaluated on large-scale financial datasets. Results show:

- Superior performance in predicting systemic risk propagation paths.
- Improved robustness across varying stress-testing conditions.
- Potential for real-world deployment in risk management and policy design.

## Applications

- Systemic risk analysis in financial institutions and markets.
- Stress testing frameworks for central banks and regulators.
- AI-driven financial risk monitoring tools.
